# Drivers-Helper

This file explains how to use Drivers Helper

Front End Process: Made using Figma, it is a single page with a button and a map. After clicking the button, the map will start locating the nearest transit

Back End Process: The backend process will connect with the official transit data base (Currently, Vietnam), and find the nearest transit. Time and Location will be extracted.
Using time, it will announce when the train/bus will be arriving, so the drivers can head over there and expect customers.
